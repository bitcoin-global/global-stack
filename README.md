Tools provided in this folder are used to help run Bitcoin Global stack using Infrastructure-as-a-Code approach for additional benefits. You can create a PR to add additional distro scripts which will help running global-stack more easily. The focus is put on deterministic automation and the speed at which the infrastructure can be up and running.

**Notes**: 
- This is work in progress and might rapidly change. For more information, as well as for immediately useable software distributions, see https://github.com/bitcoin-global/global-stack/releases.     
- As we were mostly working on Linux machines, these guides tend to faviorize Linux environment. This does not mean that replicated scripts are not going to be available for other platforms - as mentioned, it is work in progress and this will be soon focused on. In the meantime, feel free to submit a PR extending the stack for any given environment, we'll happily review and merge it.
